-  [ ] Compile AMReX in GPU mode and measure performance of Poisson solver
      for boiling simulations.

-  [ ] Restart fails for simulation/PoolBoiling/SingleBubble. Needs
      investigation.

-  [ ] Look into IO and restarting. Running production simulations on
      coarser grid and then refining during restart. See file
      simulation/PoolBoiling/Gravity-FC72-2D/grav-1.0/interpChk.py for a
      hack.

-  [ ] Facevar updates to leverage divergence free interpolation in AMReX.
      Running simulations with higher refinement.

-  [ ] Bittree AMReX updates.

-  [ ] Guard cells filling time has increased after adding more grid
      variables in physics/Multiphase, physics/IncompNS, and bc fill
      calls to Driver_evolveAll.F90 Reduce this by adjusting algorithm.

-  [ ] Immersed boundary alogrithm with ANN - use normal vectors from stl
      file.

-  [ ] Neural Poisson.
