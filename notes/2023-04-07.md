Just a list of TODOs 

- Compile AMReX in GPU mode and measure performance
of Poisson solver for boiling simulations.

- Look into IO and restarting. Running production simulations 
  on coarser grid and then refining during restart. 
  See file simulation/PoolBoiling/Gravity-FC72-2D/grav-1.0/interpChk.py for a hack.

- Facevar updates to leverage divergence free interpolation 
  in AMReX. Running simulations with higher refinement

- Bittree AMReX updates
