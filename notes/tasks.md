## Tasks

- \[x\] Introduce performance log for unittests in BoxKit.

- \[ \] Performance of Navier-Stokes solvers, GPU vs CPU, AMR vs
  non-uniform grid.

- \[ \] Direct air capture simulations

- \[ \] `yt` support

- \[ \] Improve calculation of curvature, make it smoother. Current
  implementation leads to local fluctuations in pressure: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7340.pdf

- \[ \] Read about turbulence and develop statistical operators for Flash-X
  and post-processing.

- \[ \] Modelling microlayer and material properties in boiling.

- \[x\] Immersed boundary alogrithm with ANN - use normal vectors from stl
  file.

- \[ \] Take a stock of services needed from Grid for physics units

- \[x\] Mechanics of external simulation directory see simulation/ChannelFlow/FlashExternal
